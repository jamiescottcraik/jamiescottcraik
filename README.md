# Jamie Scott Craik, FloL 🚀

**Founder, brAInwav | AI Engineering Leader | Veteran-Led Innovation | Ex-Army Ops**

> 22 years of operational command as a Warrant Officer in the British Army taught me how to solve chaos, lead teams, and adapt under fire. Medical retirement after TBI and FND wasn't the end; it forced a reset. brAInwav is my rebuild-in-public: using lived experience, accredited leadership (ILM L7, FIoL), and cutting-edge AI engineering to create technology that amplifies real minds.

## 🎯 Mission: Signals from Lived Minds

**Building AI that amplifies human experience, not replaces it.**

My work bridges military operational excellence with modern AI engineering. I'm developing veteran-led innovations that demonstrate how lived experience + technical rigour creates transformative technology. No theory, no fluff—just battle-tested leadership applied to cutting-edge AI development.

### 🚀 **Current Focus (Q3 2025)**

* 🔧 **Shipping:** [Interactive AI Engineering Roadmap](https://github.com/jamiescottcraik/ai-engineering-roadmap) – Modern React/Next.js platform with OpenUI integration, Kanban learning, and local AI capabilities
* 🤖 **Building:** [P.A.R.A.gon AI](https://github.com/jamiescottcraik/paragon-ai) – Multi-agent cognitive assistant with local-first architecture
* 📚 **Mastering:** AI Engineering Leadership ([48-week structured program](https://github.com/jamiescottcraik/ai-engineering-roadmap), 5-phase progression to industry impact)
* 🎖️ **Advocating:** Veteran integration in AI/ML careers through inclusive technology design
