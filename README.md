# Jamie Scott Craik, FloL 🚀

**Founder, brAInwav | GenAI Developer (In Training) | AI Safety & Ethics | Ex-Army Ops**

> 22 years of operational command as a Warrant Officer in the British Army taught me how to solve chaos, lead teams, and adapt under fire. Medical retirement after TBI and FND wasn't the end; it forced a reset. brAInwav is my rebuild-in-public: using lived experience, accredited leadership (ILM L7, FIoL), and hands-on GenAI training to make tech that fits real minds.

## 🎯 Mission & Focus

My work isn't theory, it's hard-learned. I'm building and testing GenAI tools for recall, decision support, and cognition, starting with what actually works for me.
Bias for action, no patience for fluff or checkbox "inclusion."

**Current Focus:**

* 🔭 **Building:** [P.A.R.A.gon AI](https://github.com/jamiescottcraik/paragon-ai) – local-first, multi-agent assistant (Python, LangChain, CrewAI)
* 🌱 **Deep in:** Generative AI engineering ([34-week structured roadmap](https://github.com/jamiescottcraik/ai-engineering-roadmap), ETA Q1 '26)
* 💬 **Interests:** RAG systems, adaptive interfaces, AI safety/ethics, MLOps on GCP
* 🤝 **Open to:** Remote roles, project teams, or collabs that value action, resilience, and learning by doing
